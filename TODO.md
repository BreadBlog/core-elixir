# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to gain basic understanding of how to use Phoenix, Elixir & OTP. I already have a server implemented in GoLang
which has served the current implementation of the blog well, but this is a good opportunity to learn a new language/framework, and apply
that new knowledge to meg after this is finished.

I will also be reading Elixir in Action and Elm in Action parallel to working on this.
